<h2>  Dos and Donts </h2>
<p> There are some things we must not do as cat owners to our cats, <br> and there are things we must do to them. </p>

 <h3> <a id="doit"> A Few of Your Cats' Likings </h3> </a>
 <p> A list of some of the things we should do that cats like. </p> 
<ul type="square">
<li> Do play with them if you can. Doing this helps your pet exercise and makes them less stressed.
<li> Do feed them wet cat food. A dry kibble diet is not healthy for your cat.
<li> Do pet your cats. They need love and assurance too.
<li> Do keep their litterboxes clean.
<li> Do provide an extra pillow or foam because cats NEED to scratch.
<li> Do let your cats spend their time outside even if it is just for a bit.

</ul>


<h3> <a id="donot"> What is Not Good for Cats? </h3> </a>
<p> A list of some things we should not do to and with our cats. </p>
<ul type="square">
<li> Do not tolerate dirty litter boxes. These make your cats uncomfortable and might eliminate their waste elsewhere.
<li> Do not rub their bellies, especially if they are wild cats. <br> You CAN rub their bellies, but most cats don't like them. Or else they will scratch you.
<li> Do not tolerate a dry kibble-only diet.
<li> Do not eat any citrus near them because the smell is too strong for them.
<li> Do not be too loud as cats hate loud and crowded places/people.
<li> Do not bring them along car rides as they may have motion sickness. If ever, go to a vet and check if your cat has motion sickness.
<li> Do not pet them aggressively.
<li> Do not go to the vet and ask them to cut off all of your cat's nails. This affects your cat greatly.\
<li> Do not spay your female cats without them experiencing birth beforehand.
