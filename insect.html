<h2> <a id="strayed"> Specific Survival Instincts of Wild Cats </h2> <a>
<p style="font-family:arial narrow;color:003152;font-size:18px;"> Cats are brave creatures. They are good at thriving for themselves and are careful at all times.<br>
Their way of survival is well done, and here are some instincts of stray or wild cats. <br> </p>
<table cellspacing= "5" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
 <td> 1.  Although they already have a hunting instinct, wild cats are extremely good at hunting and have strong hunting instincts.
 </tr>
 <td> 2.  They enjoy stalking and killing their prey. </tr>
 <td> 3.  They mark their scents or engage in scent marking more. </tr>
 <td> 4.  They have a more specific diet to follow, which is hard to maintain in householdsâ€” making them more different from domestic cats. </tr>
 <td> 5.  They are also highly territorial  as they are more competitive and will do anything to protect their territories. </tr>

<h2> <a id="householded"> Specific Instincts of Domesticated Cats </h2> <a>
<p style="font-family:arial narrow;color:003152;font-size:18px;"> We all look at our cats and think that they are such lazy creatures. All they do is eat, sleep, play, and repeat. <br>
As we talked about their natural instincts and wild cat instincts, now we'll talk about some instincts of domesticated cats. </p>

<table cellspacing= "5" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
<td> 1.  They may start hunting for rats, mice, or lizards in your home as they still have a hunting instinct within them.
</tr>
<td> 2.  They might compete with your other cats for food.
</tr>
<td> 3.  If you have unneutered male cats, they may pee in certain places to mark their scent.
</tr>
<td> 4.  They have an unspecific diet or could be specific, but handling domestic cats are less of a struggle than with wild cats when it comes to food.
