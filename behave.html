<h3> <a id="play"> When Playing </h3> </a>
<p> Cats are complex creatures and are one of a kind. <br> They are perfect to have as pets and are somehow
therapeutic to us humans. <br> Now, as joyful and enjoyable as they can be, they are also confusing. <br>
Here are <b>some ways</b> to tell when a cat wants to play with you or not: <br> </p>

<ul type="square"> 

<li> They have sudden erratic movements and are unpredictable with their actions.

<li> They constantly run around the house as if they're being chased, <br> or perhaps act like they're chasing something.

<li> Having increased levels of energy. They are probably more joyful and playful <br> than they usually are.
<li> Often have their eyes focused on an object.
<li> Perhaps they'd also start biting your feet as a <br> gesture of wanting to play with you.

</ul>

<h3> <a id="litter"> When Littering </h3> </a>
<p> Cats are also really clean animals. <br> They could also be choosy with their litter boxes. <br>
As a cat owner, you should know how your cat acts, <br> especially when they're trying to use their sandbox. <br> 
<b> Below are actions your cats may have been doing </b> <br> when minding their business in their sandbox. </p>

<ul type="square">   
<li> You may notice your kitten running into their box, then leaving very quickly right after.
<li> You also may notice your little animal releasing its wastes near the box, not inside it.
<li> Your cat may also enter their little box to use it but it may hesitate to go in, <br> usually because they may have found something unappealing inside. 
<li> They may have issues with the box itself. Your cat may be scratching surfaces that isn't the litterbox. <br> This means they may have issues with their box.
<li> Cats may also avoid the box and take longer to potty or pee, <br> meaning that the box may be dirty and may have been uncomfortable for them to use. 
</ul>

<h3> <a id="hungry"> When Hungry </h3> </a>
<p> Cats are very lazy and food-obsessed creatures, just like you. <br>
So, here are some factors your cats may be doing to ask for food: <br> </p>

<ul type="square">
<li> They would excel more and try to play with you. This hints that they want attention and are hungry.
<li> They're bored. Some cats just ask for food out of boredom.
<li> They're clingy. As we have clingy cats, we also have non-clingy cats. <br> If they're not usually clingy, they may cling onto you to show that they are hungry.
<li> They could be whining during your mealtime. They'd start crying and meowing nonstop, to hint their hunger.  
<li> They also may hang around, meowing near where their food is stored. 
</ul>

<h3> <a id="ate"> When Eating </h3> </a>
<p> If you've noticed, your cats may have certain actions or gestures when eating. <br>
Here are a few reasons onto why they may be doing this: </p>
<ul type="square">
<li> If you have seen then getting angry at your other cats, <br> it means they are keeping the food for themselves, or at least, trying to. <br> Cats are usually competitive when it comes to their resources.
<li> If you've seen them put their food on the ground, it's because they're hunters. <br> They do this act because if they were to hunt,
they would be dragging the animal to eat.
<li> If they scratch their bowl or plate, it could be because of their instinct to hide their leftovers, like other animals.
<li> If your cat is meowing while eating, it may be due to the fact that they're still hungry and <br>  they aren't getting enough food to eat.
<li> If your cat doesn't eat their food yet and still asks for more, it may be caused by their boredom, <br> or worse, their lack of calories. <br> They may keep whining and crying because they need calories. 
</ul>
