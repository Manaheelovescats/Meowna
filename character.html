<h1 style="font-family:georgia;color:3C73A8;"> Characteristics </h3>               
<p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:253DA1;font-size:17px;">
 What do you want to know about cats? 
What characteristics do you think they have? Are there necessary facts you should know about them?
Well, yes. This page will show you some of their different characteristics, and guide you throughout your cat-owning journey. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:georgia;color:3C73A8;" align=center> What are some of their characteristics? </h4>

 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 1.  Cats are very furry. As we do have hairless cats (such as the Sphinx), the majority of their population is hairy. So, if you're asthmatic, you would be allergic to them. </p>

 <p style= "font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 2.  They have sharp teeth, which are specialized for hunting their prey. </p>

 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 3.  Their bodies are powerful. They are reflexive and can practically jump up from high places with a higher chance of surviving than jumping from low-ranged places. </p>
 
 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 4.  Cats perform excessive grooming. They love to clean themselves and do it a lot every day. Another fact is they're very clean creatures and are cleaner than dogs! </p>

 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 5.  They are aggressive. Because they ARE hunters, they may be aggressive towards humans, especially if they're wild cats.
But of course, they are also aggressive towards other animals and are aggressive to other cats as well. </p>


 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 6.  Cats are sociable. Although they're hunters who hunt alone, unlike dogs, they're sociable to humans, to other cats, and perhaps other animals as well. </p>

 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 7.  They're loners. I'm sure when you see wild cats, they're mostly alone and are by themselves. And as I've mentioned before, that's because they're hunters who hunt alone. </p>

 <p style="font-family: arial narrow;color:02055A;font-size:17px;"> 8. Their claws are sharp and retractable. Though you should get your cat's nails trimmed, do not cut them off fully, or else it'll result in your cat's depression as they are no longer able to use their claws for scratching, which is very essential in their lives. </p>
